## Review of "AI‑Powered Memories: Organizing Sports‑Camp Photos & Videos"

The article lays out a practical, open‑source pipeline for tagging athletes and producing highlight reels. It is strong on tooling specifics but could better articulate value propositions and scalability considerations for stakeholders.

### Suggestions
- **Quantify outcomes.** Include metrics on time saved, tagging accuracy, and cost per 1k images compared with manual workflows.
- **Data governance.** Address parental consent, face‑embedding retention policies, and GDPR/CCPA implications for youth data.
- **Resilience and scaling.** Discuss how the pipeline performs with higher frame rates or multi‑day tournaments, and options for edge vs cloud deployment.
- **Extensibility roadmap.** Suggest modules for sponsor branding, analytics dashboards, or integration with existing camp management systems.
- **Competitive landscape.** Briefly compare to commercial services to justify build‑vs‑buy decisions.

### Verdict
A hands‑on guide that would resonate even more with decision‑makers if tied to compliance, cost comparisons, and growth pathways.
