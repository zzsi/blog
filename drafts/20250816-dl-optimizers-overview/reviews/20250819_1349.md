## Review of "From Heavy Ball to Muon: a scholar’s tour of deep-learning optimizers"

An insightful historical narrative of optimizers up to 2025 with strong references. For leadership, the piece could tie the survey to concrete training decisions and cost trade‑offs.

### Suggestions
- **Executive summary.** Distill key eras and when each optimizer is appropriate into a quick‑reference table.
- **Performance benchmarks.** Provide empirical comparisons on representative model sizes to guide selection.
- **Systems implications.** Highlight memory footprints, distributed training compatibility, and hardware efficiency for each family.
- **Risk considerations.** Discuss failure modes—e.g., instability with large learning rates—and monitoring strategies.
- **Future bets.** Outline which experimental optimizers (Muon, Lion, etc.) merit pilot investment and expected ROI.
- **Tooling pointers.** Link to production‑ready libraries or configurations for popular frameworks.

### Verdict
A rich educational piece that would better serve decision‑makers with tables, performance data, and guidance on when to adopt emerging optimizers.
