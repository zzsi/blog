## Review of "3D Vision Primer & Recent Advances (Canvas Edition)"

The primer functions as modular sticky notes for engineers entering 3D vision. It is dense and technical, ideal for practitioners, yet could orient executives more clearly.

### Suggestions
- **Audience framing.** Explain when an organization should invest in 3D vision capabilities and what problems they unlock.
- **Architecture overview.** Provide a high‑level flow from data capture to rendering so non‑specialists grasp how the cards relate.
- **Cost and tooling.** Mention hardware requirements and open‑source vs commercial options for key techniques (NeRF, 3DGS, SLAM).
- **Case examples.** Highlight two industries (e.g., robotics, AR marketing) and describe ROI or deployment hurdles.
- **Risk profile.** Note issues like compute demand, data privacy for spatial scans, and maintainability of neural rendering pipelines.
- **Learning path.** Suggest a prioritized order for teams upskilling from classical to neural approaches.

### Verdict
A flexible technical cheat sheet that would benefit from strategic context and implementation guidance for leadership buy‑in.
