## Review of "If AI Can Win an IMO Gold Medal, Why Bother Learning Math?"

This expanded edition addresses the education debate with historical context and practical advice. It is engaging, but as an executive I would look for stronger links to workforce strategy and policy.

### Suggestions
- **Workforce implications.** Quantify which math‑heavy roles are most exposed and how curricula could shift to higher‑order skills.
- **Case studies.** Showcase companies or universities piloting AI‑assisted math programs and the outcomes they observed.
- **Tooling guidance.** Provide a shortlist of AI math assistants and criteria for safe classroom or workplace adoption.
- **Metrics.** Suggest how to measure conceptual mastery vs. reliance on automation in training programs.
- **Equity considerations.** Discuss access gaps—schools with limited compute or faculty—and mitigation strategies.
- **Future scenarios.** Frame 3‑5 plausible paths for math education over the next decade and their strategic impact.

### Verdict
A thought‑provoking narrative that would benefit from actionable frameworks for educators and employers navigating AI‑level math proficiency.
