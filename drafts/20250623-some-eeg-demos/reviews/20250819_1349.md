## Review of "Real‑Time EEG: From Mood‑Driven Music to Neuroadaptive Worlds"

A comprehensive survey of hobbyist‑friendly EEG applications with impressive technical detail. For an executive reader, the piece could convert better by linking the demos to business value and governance.

### Suggestions
- **Clarify maturity levels.** A table mapping each demo to TRL (tech readiness level) and required hardware cost helps prioritize investment.
- **Highlight ROI scenarios.** Brief case studies—e.g., driver‑alertness monitoring reducing accidents—would ground the excitement in measurable outcomes.
- **Regulatory and privacy notes.** Explicitly address handling of biometric data, consent flows, and cross‑border compliance.
- **Operational playbook.** Suggest partner ecosystems or open‑source stacks that a company could pilot within one quarter.
- **Risk register.** Call out failure modes like sensor drift, data security, and false positives, along with mitigation steps.

### Verdict
Inspirational overview that would benefit from clearer commercialization pathways and governance guidance.
