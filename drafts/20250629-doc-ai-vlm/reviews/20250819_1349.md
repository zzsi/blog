## Review of "Modern Document AI & Vision‑Language Models – A 2025 Technical Recap"

The recap is an encyclopedic tour of document AI and VLM research. It is rich with citations and tables, but at  extensive length it risks overwhelming senior readers seeking direction rather than coverage.

### Suggestions
- **Executive summary.** Condense the key shifts (promptable OCR, long‑context VLMs, LoRA fine‑tuning) into a one‑page briefing with ROI angles.
- **Adoption pathways.** Provide tiered recommendations: quick wins with LayoutLM variants, medium‑term pilots with open VLMs, and high‑risk research bets.
- **Cost & resource framing.** Include rough training/inference budgets, hardware requirements, and open‑source vs commercial trade‑offs.
- **Governance spotlight.** Add a section on data privacy, auditability, and human‑in‑the‑loop processes for regulated industries.
- **Competitive landscape.** Contrast open models with major vendor APIs to guide build‑vs‑buy decisions.
- **Use‑case case studies.** Summaries of two deployments (e.g., invoice processing, HR forms) would anchor the theory.

### Verdict
A valuable reference that needs tighter storytelling and decision frameworks to serve executives planning real deployments.
