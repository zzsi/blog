## Review of "Beyond Counsel: Why Citizens Deserve a Right to Sufficient AI Advisory"

The essay makes a compelling moral case for a civic right to AI advisory, drawing parallels to legal counsel. For leaders in policy or industry, it would benefit from more operational clarity.

### Suggestions
- **Define sufficiency metrics.** Propose measurable thresholds for accuracy, transparency, and response time to avoid an unfunded mandate.
- **Pilot evidence.** Include data from small‑scale deployments (e.g., Estonia’s Kratt, NHS chatbots) to show feasibility and cost curves.
- **Governance model.** Sketch funding mechanisms, accountability structures, and interaction with private providers.
- **Scope boundaries.** Clarify which domains (healthcare, finance, education) warrant early inclusion and which may remain market‑led.
- **Risk mitigation.** Address potential misuse, over‑reliance, or bias and outline audit and escalation procedures.
- **Stakeholder map.** Identify agencies, NGOs, and industry partners needed to build a coalition.

### Verdict
A persuasive vision that needs concrete standards, pilot results, and implementation pathways to move policymakers from agreement to action.
