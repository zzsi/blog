On a gray Tuesday morning, María Alvarez sat at her kitchen table, laptop open, eyes darting between half‑finished coffee and a health‑insurance marketplace she barely understood. She was forty‑nine, newly self‑employed, and one misclick away from locking herself into a plan that could swallow half her annual income—or leave her uncovered when she needed care most. The instructions were written in courteous but opaque prose, the deductible tables hid behind hyperlinks, and actuarial terms—coinsurance, out‑of‑pocket maximum, formulary tiers—bloomed like weeds everywhere she looked.

So María did what many of us do: she guessed. She chose the third cheapest plan, prayed she was healthy enough, and hoped she hadn’t made a catastrophic mistake.

If María had been facing a criminal charge instead of an insurance portal, she would have had the U.S. Constitution at her back. The Sixth Amendment guarantees her the right to competent legal counsel, paid for by the state if she cannot afford it. Society long ago recognized that ordinary citizens cannot possibly match the technical skill, specialized language, and professional resources of prosecutors. We insist on balance—not because every defendant is innocent, but because dignity demands everyone participate meaningfully in decisions that can upend a life.

**The digital world has reached a similar tipping point.** Algorithms weigh in on everything from credit limits to college admissions; bureaucracies publish ever‑expanding rulebooks; corporations negotiate contracts in font sizes small enough to dodge notice. The gap between expert knowledge and everyday understanding is now a canyon, and it is widening faster than traditional institutions can respond.

That is why I believe we should begin talking seriously about a new civic guarantee: a **right to sufficient AI advisory**.

> “If technology is a form of power, then access to the best advice it can synthesize is a form of freedom.”

### The Counsel Analogy—And Where It Breaks

When Clarence Earl Gideon stood before the Supreme Court in 1963, penniless and accused of burglary, he asked for a lawyer. The Court agreed he had a constitutional right to one, cementing the idea that some forms of expertise are so instrumental to justice that government must help supply them. Today, prosecutors still outnumber public defenders and funding remains tight, but the principle is uncontested: navigating criminal law without a guide is fundamentally unfair.

Now replace the courtroom with a mortgage refinancing screen, or a disability‑benefit appeal, or a small‑business tax schedule. We are again asking citizens to decode labyrinthine systems written by specialists, enforced automatically, and outcome‑determinative for livelihoods. The difference is scale: millions more daily interactions, far less theatrical than a trial, but cumulatively just as consequential.

And yet the modern state offers little beyond PDF instructions and understaffed call centers. Private‑sector tools exist—chatbots that suggest tax deductions, symptom‑checker apps, credit‑card comparison sites—but these come with advertising incentives, hidden data harvesting, or narrow purpose. They owe no fiduciary duty to the user. They are not counsel; they are sales reps wearing AI skins.

### What Does "Sufficient" Mean?

Lawyers are judged by a standard of competence that evolves as precedent and practice mature. A right to AI advisory would need its own evolving yardstick. Here is a starting sketch:

* **Competence:** The advisor must meet a statistically validated accuracy threshold and surface the provenance of its suggestions. Explaining *why* Plan A is safer than Plan B cannot be optional.
* **Independence:** It must be structurally insulated from the organizations whose products or rules it critiques—no undisclosed referral fees, no upsells embedded in advice.
* **Accessibility:** Free at the point of use, multilingual, and designed for people with limited digital literacy or disabilities. In effect, an ADA for algorithms.
* **Privacy:** User data stays siloed, encrypted, and never sold. Recall how attorney‑client privilege undergirds trust; an AI counterpart needs similar guardrails.

If those criteria sound ambitious, remember that Gideon did not instantly materialize armies of public defenders; it set an aspiration, forcing institutions to build toward it.

### Early Glimpses of the Future

You can already see prototypes flickering into existence. Estonia’s nationwide “Kratt” virtual assistant helps residents navigate government services in natural language. Spain’s *Carta de Derechos Digitales* enshrines a right to algorithmic transparency. The European Union’s AI Act, passed in 2024, classifies public‑service AI as “high‑risk,” demanding audits and human oversight. None of these, however, amount to a *right* to personal AI counsel. They regulate providers, not empower citizens.

On the commercial side, TurboTax’s AI coach and the NHS’s 111 triage chatbot inch closer, yet both remain company properties, not public assets. Their loyalties are negotiated by terms of service, not constitutional mandate.

### Why Enshrine a Right?

**Cognitive Equity** The internet gave us universal publishing; AI promises universal analysis. Leaving that promise to market forces risks entrenching a new knowledge aristocracy—the well advised versus the algorithmically outmatched.

**Procedural Justice** Whether you receive cancer treatment, student‑loan forgiveness, or child‑care subsidies increasingly hinges on opaque risk scores and rule checks. A right to AI advisory restores a measure of symmetry between citizen and system.

**Economic Efficiency** Mistakes are expensive. The 2019 Dutch child‑benefit scandal—where flawed fraud algorithms wrecked thousands of families—will cost billions in reparations and lost productivity. Preventive advice is cheaper than post‑hoc scandal management.

**Democratic Feedback** Aggregated, anonymized queries can reveal which statutes confuse citizens most, guiding legislators toward clearer drafting—an iterative loop of governance enhanced by data.

### Common Pushback—and Rebuttals

"**Won’t people become dependent on AI?**" Some will; many already rely on GPS. The goal is not to replace human judgment but to scaffold it. Just as a lawyer doesn’t rob you of agency, neither would an advisory model that explains choices, cites evidence, and invites override.

"**AI is biased; why codify its role?**" Because bias thrives in darkness. A statutory right would come bundled with audit requirements, redress mechanisms, and a public‑interest mandate—the opposite of today’s unregulated chatbots.

"**This sounds expensive.**" Training a domain‑specific language model is orders of magnitude cheaper than staffing equivalent human expertise for every citizen interaction. Moreover, cost‑sharing frameworks—open‑source models, public cloud credits, civic‑tech partnerships—can drive marginal costs toward zero.

"**Private companies already offer tools.**" Public defenders coexist with private attorneys; both have roles. The right protects those who cannot afford premium services and compels baseline quality across the board.

### How Might We Get There?

1. **Statutory Seeds** Congress or parliaments could graft an advisory clause onto existing consumer‑protection or administrative‑procedure acts, starting with high‑impact domains like healthcare or housing.
2. **Pilot Sandboxes** Governments partner with universities and civic nonprofits to deploy open‑weight models, testing accuracy, bias, and user experience on opt‑in populations.
3. **Certification and Liability** An oversight body—think Financial Ombudsman meets Public Defender—licenses advisory systems, rescinds certification for repeated harms, and adjudicates complaints.
4. **Open Rulebooks** Agencies publish regulations in machine‑readable formats, allowing continuous retraining and independent verification.

History teaches that rights evolve from practice as much as proclamation. Small pilots snowball into expectations, expectations ossify into precedent, and precedent hardens into law.

### A Global View

The conversation won’t unfold only in Washington or Brussels. Kenya’s Huduma number, India’s Aadhaar‑linked welfare portals, and Brazil’s open‑government data initiatives all raise the same question: When digital systems mediate citizenship, what guarantees shield the individual? A right to AI advisory could become a lingua franca of digital rights, traveling across legal cultures the way freedom of expression did in the twentieth century.

### Closing Thoughts: Choosing the Future We Inhabit

Near the end of *Gideon’s Trumpet*, Anthony Lewis writes that Gideon’s victory mattered not because it freed one man, but because it signaled America’s capacity for self‑correction. The machinery of law bent, however incrementally, toward fairness.

We stand at another inflection point. The machinery now is digital, the decisions diffuse, the stakes disguised under user‑agreement click‑boxes. Yet the principle endures: power without accessible counter‑power breeds injustice. Granting every citizen a right to sufficient AI advisory would not make bureaucracy disappear, but it would supply the flashlight, the map, and the translator that modern life increasingly demands.

María Alvarez should not have to gamble her health on a hunch. Neither should you.

*If technology is to remain a tool of emancipation rather than domination, counsel by code may be the right whose hour has come.*
