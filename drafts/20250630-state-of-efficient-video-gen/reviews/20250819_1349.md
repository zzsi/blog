## Review of "Cutting Latency, Keeping Creativity — The 2025 Status of Efficient Video Generation"

The draft captures cutting‑edge research and reads like a field report for engineers. It succeeds technically but would benefit from stronger translation into business outcomes.

### Suggestions
- **Context setting.** Begin with industries feeling the latency pinch (e.g., live commerce, training sims) and the size of the opportunity.
- **Prioritize insights.** Distill the sprawling model list into a decision matrix by use case, GPU budget, and IP constraints.
- **TCO analysis.** Provide rough cost per minute of generated video for reference deployments.
- **Vendor vs open source.** Address when to rely on proprietary APIs versus self‑hosted stacks, including compliance and support considerations.
- **Risk and quality metrics.** Explain how teams should measure consistency, safety, and compute utilization when scaling pilots.
- **Roadmap.** Outline a phased adoption plan—prototype, pilot, production—with milestone criteria.

### Verdict
Highly informative but needs cost framing and adoption guidance to help executives green‑light investments.
