## Review of "Automating Kaggle Competitions with ML Agents"

The article maps the evolution from AutoML to LLM‑driven agents and catalogs frameworks and benchmarks. Executives will appreciate the momentum but need clearer implications for product teams and budgets.

### Suggestions
- **Business framing.** Start with why automated Kaggle performance matters for enterprise ML (faster prototyping, smaller teams).
- **Comparison table.** Summarize AutoKaggle, DSMentor, Agent K etc. by required resources, performance, and maintenance burden.
- **Risk and governance.** Mention IP considerations when scraping community notebooks, and safeguards against data leakage in automated submissions.
- **Integration guidance.** Describe how these agents might plug into existing MLOps stacks and where human review remains critical.
- **Cost estimates.** Provide rough compute spend to reach top‑quintile leaderboard results versus manual efforts.
- **Future outlook.** Highlight gaps—e.g., handling tabular + vision combos—and what advances would unlock new business value.

### Verdict
A forward‑looking survey that would benefit from explicit ROI framing and operational guidance for organizations considering agent‑driven experimentation.
