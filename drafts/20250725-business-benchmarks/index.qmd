# Practical Business Benchmarks for AI: Existing Landscape and Gaps

**Overview:** Academic benchmarks like those from [Epoch AI](https://epochai.org/) or [BIG-Bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) test "book smarts"‚Äîgeneral knowledge, theoretical reasoning, and symbolic problem-solving. While these are important, organizations deploying AI systems in the real world care more about **"street smarts"**: practical problem-solving, workflow orchestration, business insight generation, and actionability. These skills are rarely captured in generic academic benchmarks. What‚Äôs needed are **practical, vertically focused business benchmarks**‚Äîevaluations that measure how well AI systems, agents, and toolchains perform in the messiness of real-world work. This document surveys such benchmarks, identifies where gaps remain, and outlines how AI consulting firms are uniquely positioned to create the next wave of impactful, street-smart evaluations.

## Existing Domain-Specific Benchmarks in Business

### Consulting & Management Case Benchmarks

* **[MgmtBench (ICLR 2024)](https://github.com/mgmt-bench/mgmt-bench)**: Includes 610 short management ‚Äúmini-cases‚Äù across strategy, operations, marketing, and finance. Each case presents a \~200-word scenario followed by either MCQs or open-ended prompts, with structured rubrics and automated grading via ROUGE/BLEURT.
* **[ConsultBench (ACL 2024)](https://github.com/consult-ai/consultbench)**: Contains 150 full-length dialog-style consulting case interviews, scored on criteria like issue tree structure, quantitative reasoning, and recommendation quality.
* **[BizQA v1.0 (2024)](https://github.com/nyu-dsr/bizqa)**: Derived from MBA course exams and books like *Case in Point*, BizQA contains 12k short-answer Q\&A pairs across domains like accounting, strategy, and economics.

**Insight:** These benchmarks simulate traditional consulting knowledge tasks. Models fine-tuned on domain data and supported with tool-use (e.g. Pandas, calculators) outperform zero-shot LLMs by wide margins. Yet even top-tier models fall short of human consultants, especially in open-ended reasoning and strategic synthesis.

---

### Enterprise Decision Simulations

* **[B-Suite (NeurIPS 2025, under review)](https://opensource.fb.com/research/b-suite)**: Introduces 45 interactive business simulations involving pricing, market entry, supply chain planning, and more. Each simulation requires the model to act as a decision agent, stepping through a task with reward feedback and programmatic scoring.

**Insight:** Tool-augmented agents using planning + execution loops (e.g. Python calculators, scratchpads) consistently outperform pure generative baselines. But solving these simulations remains hard: most models complete fewer than 25% optimally. This underscores the challenge of **multi-step, tool-intensive reasoning** in complex domains.

---

### Executive Communication

* **[ExecBench (ICML 2025)](https://github.com/exec-bench/execbench)**: Provides \~220 CEO memos (some with tabular exhibits) that require summarization into a 3-slide board deck. Scoring focuses on clarity, insightfulness, and strategic actionability, as rated by expert MBAs and executives.

**Insight:** Tasks mimic real business reporting workflows. RAG-enhanced LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o + LlamaIndex over investor letters) score near human average (\~3.9/5 vs \~4.2). However, handling mixed media (text + charts) and inferring deeper strategic insights still present difficulties.

---

### Healthcare & Medical

* **[MedQA](https://github.com/jind11/MedQA)** and **[MedMCQA](https://medmcqa.github.io/)**: Evaluate USMLE-style medical Q\&A.
* **BenchHealth (closed)**: Evaluates nuanced clinical reasoning under uncertainty.

**Insight:** Medical benchmarks test high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. LLMs often need grounding via structured knowledge bases, and performance is brittle without prompt engineering or tool use. Hallucinations can be dangerous‚Äîhighlighting the need for **faithfulness checks**.

---

### Finance & Economics

* **[FinQA](https://github.com/czyssrs/FinQA)** and **[ConvFinQA](https://github.com/microsoft/ConvFinQA)**: Test a model's ability to compute values from financial reports and tables.
* **FinanceBench** (internal, 2025): Designed to test LLMs on compliance-sensitive KPI modeling, cashflow projections, and risk analysis tasks.

**Insight:** Text-only models struggle with math-heavy finance tasks. Those integrated with spreadsheets or calculator tools perform better. Compliance reasoning (e.g. interpreting financial regulation) remains underdeveloped.

---

### Legal

* **[LegalBench](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench)**: Tests statute application, rule classification, and clause interpretation.
* **[CaseHOLD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lex_glue)**: A classification benchmark for matching facts to case law holdings.

**Insight:** Legal LLMs must parse complex logic and jurisdictional nuance. Most current models can extract clauses but fail to reason across multiple statutes or case precedents.

---

### Customer Support & Workflow Agents

* **[CLASSIC (ICLR 2025 Workshop)](https://github.com/agents-research/classic-benchmark)**: A benchmark built from 2,133 real enterprise chat logs in domains like IT, HR, banking, and healthcare. Tasks involve identifying the correct workflow, maintaining safety, and minimizing latency.

**Insight:** Unlike static QA, CLASSIC tests real workflow reasoning and escalation. Top agents achieve \~76% accuracy, with large variance in safety behavior (some fail 20%+ of jailbreak tests).

## Gaps and Under-Served Areas

### üß† Vertical Gaps

| Vertical            | Benchmark Coverage | Gaps                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Marketing & Sales   | Very limited       | Ad generation, audience targeting, CRM summarization   |
| Retail & E-commerce | Sparse             | Product search, catalog curation, Q\&A, inventory flow |
| Logistics           | Only simulations   | Real-world routing, demand prediction, ERP integration |
| HR                  | Absent             | Resume screening, policy QA, onboarding workflows      |
| Manufacturing       | None               | Sensor log parsing, factory optimization, root-cause   |

These are **pain point areas** where no robust public benchmarks exist. They remain largely unmeasured and unexplored by the LLM community.

### üìä Modality & Workflow Gaps

* **Multimodal inputs**: Few benchmarks evaluate AI agents working across documents, tables, and charts in a unified task.
* **Spreadsheet + tool interop**: Most benchmarks lack steps where an agent edits Excel, runs SQL, or invokes dashboards.
* **Memory over time**: Benchmarks test single turns or short episodes; few assess agents persisting knowledge over sessions.
* **Messy real-world data**: Academic benchmarks are too clean. Business data is noisy, outdated, or incomplete.

## Opportunities for Consulting Firms to Create Benchmarks

### Why Consulting Firms Are Well Positioned

AI consulting firms interact with client pain points daily. They help design AI systems to improve existing business workflows‚Äîoften dealing with:

* Unstructured PDFs, legacy reports, and spreadsheets
* Workflow routing rules and access controls
* Real-time analytics, dashboards, and KPIs
* Decision-making under uncertainty
* Business process optimization and cost control

This gives consulting teams deep insight into which tasks are most valuable‚Äîand which are most error-prone or bottlenecked. That‚Äôs why they are ideally placed to translate these into **machine-gradable benchmarks**.

### Design Principles

* Simulate full-stack workflows (retrieval + planning + tool use).
* Use real-world noise: bad formatting, contradictory data, vague requests.
* Evaluate outputs with rubrics (clarity, impact, bias, cost).
* Track chain-of-thought fidelity and tool correctness.

## Key Takeaway

The **2025 frontier** for AI evaluation is not more academic trivia‚Äîit's **real-world, messy, business-critical workflows**. The best-performing systems integrate:

* Long-context LLMs
* RAG over internal documents
* Code or spreadsheet execution tools
* Safety filters and refusal handling

Consulting firms are best positioned to design the **benchmarks that reflect reality**‚Äîbenchmarks that will shape how enterprises trust, adopt, and scale AI.
