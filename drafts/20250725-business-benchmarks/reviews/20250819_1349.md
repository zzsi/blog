## Review of "Practical Business Benchmarks for AI: Existing Landscape and Gaps"

The post catalogues a wide array of domain benchmarks and highlights vertical gaps. It’s a strong foundation, yet senior readers may want a clearer path from list to action.

### Suggestions
- **Executive summary table.** Rank benchmarks by maturity, required tooling, and business value to guide quick adoption.
- **Design principles.** Offer a repeatable methodology for firms to craft new benchmarks from client engagements.
- **Data access & licensing.** Discuss how to handle proprietary client data when forming public benchmarks.
- **Measurement guidance.** Suggest standardized metrics (e.g., ROI, accuracy, latency) and acceptable baselines for each domain.
- **Ecosystem strategy.** Identify partners—cloud vendors, consultancies, academia—to co-develop and maintain benchmarks.
- **Governance and bias.** Include a checklist for ethical evaluation design to avoid codifying systemic bias.

### Verdict
Informative survey that would benefit from a playbook converting benchmark gaps into funded projects and partnerships.
