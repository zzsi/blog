## Review of "Presentation" (draft reveal.js deck)

The draft shows a barebones slide deck with no narrative. For executives, clarify the use case and ensure the deck scaffolds an actual story.

### Suggestions
- **Purpose statement.** Explain what talk or meeting this deck supports and the key takeaway for the audience.
- **Structure.** Outline sections (problem, approach, results, next steps) rather than a single slide.
- **Branding and design.** Include template guidance for consistent fonts, colors, and logos.
- **Interactive elements.** Demonstrate code or visual demos to justify using reveal.js.
- **Distribution plan.** Note how to export to PDF or host internally for review.

### Verdict
Currently a placeholder. Expanding with story flow and design conventions would make it a reusable presentation template.
