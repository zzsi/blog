## Review of "Pratical retrieval augmented generation (RAG)"

The draft gives a succinct introduction to retrieval augmentation and the three insertion points. From an executive lens, it reads more like meeting notes than an action guide. The opportunity is large—reduced hallucination and lower compute—but stakeholders will want evidence and a roadmap.

### Suggestions
- **Anchor with a case study.** Quantify how retrieval changed accuracy or cost in a real workflow (e.g., contract review, support bot) and show before/after metrics.
- **Decision matrix.** Add a table on when to prefer prompt‑level, attention‑level, or output‑level retrieval, highlighting latency, engineering complexity, and risk.
- **Architecture sketch.** Briefly outline data sources, vector store choices, cache strategy, and monitoring signals executives should fund.
- **Risk management.** Note failure modes—stale embeddings, PII leakage, model drift—and controls for each.
- **Deployment playbook.** What’s a 90‑day pilot plan? List team roles, budget envelope, and success criteria.

### Verdict
Promising overview but needs concrete metrics, architectural guidance, and rollout steps to persuade a leadership audience.
