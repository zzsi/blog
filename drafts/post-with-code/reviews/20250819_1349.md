## Review of "Post With Code"

A minimal demo showing executable code in a blog post. For a senior audience, the post should clarify its purposeâ€”tutorial, pattern, or announcement.

### Suggestions
- **Context.** Explain why executable posts matter (reproducibility, interactive docs) and reference frameworks like Quarto or Jupyter.
- **Security note.** Warn about running arbitrary code and recommend sandboxing or environment specs.
- **Expansion.** Add a real example: small data analysis or visualization that showcases value beyond `print("Hello!")`.
- **Call to action.** Point readers to repository structure or templates so teams can replicate the setup.

### Verdict
Effective as a placeholder, but to inspire adoption it should demonstrate a meaningful workflow and address security concerns.
