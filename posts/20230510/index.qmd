## When you leave

When you leave this world, your body slowly become one with the surrounding air and soil. You cannot take away the money, the power, or belongings. Gone is your love and hate, joy and regret. Gone is the memory of your family and friends. Gone is the frustration with unfairness and injustice.

But your impact remains. What you give this world remains.

## The miniscule self

As I age, I realize the unimportance of oneself. The world runs perfectly without me. The humanity is magnificent: the road we drive on, the sewege we use everyday, the clothes we wear, the music we listen to, the food we eat, the books we read, the movies we watch were created by hundreds of thousands of people. I depend on, consume and enjoy all given to me. The amount I can give back is miniscule.

I aspire for great things I can do, the great impact I can make. Reality humbles me. Sometimes I feel I am barely useful.

What I struggle to achieve, I can help and coach people with dreams and energy to do so. The road I don't have time to explore, I can show the way to the curious.
