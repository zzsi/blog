## GPTs, App Store for LLMs?

On OpenAI Dev day, an important feature was announced that allows users to create custom GPTs by uploading documents, tailoring instructions and connecting the GPT model to plugins like web browsing. I have been using it and it helps my work and life. Here are two examples:

- I created a GPT to help me understand research papers. To research a topic such as "video generation with diffusion models", I downloaded papers from Arxiv, and simply upload to my GPT. I can then ask questions like "how do diffusion models ensure temporary consistency of generated videos", and it will answer my question by referencing snippets from the papers.
- My 10 year old is into Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. He created a GPT to help him with the game by using the web browsing plugin. He has been telling me it helped him a lot.

## Retrieval augmented generation

When you chat with a custom GPT, what happens is a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) process. Without changing the models weights (a.k.a. no fine-tuning), you get a customized GPT. The core LLM gets access to one or more data sources that can be frequently updated. The data source can be a your own documents, a knowledge base built by your team, or the whole web.

Many have built and shared RAG applications using open source tools like Langchain and LlamaIndex, on top of a proprietary OpenAI model such as GPT3.5. Important knobs include:

- prompt template
- prompt flow (linear, tree)

In terms of quality of outputs from such systems, OpenAI's GPT models have been quite ahead of competitors.

## Are open source alternatives actually good?

I have been using GPT3.5-turbo for most of my LLM applications. Now there are viable open source alternatives with a permissive license.

On [Chatbot Arena](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard), Mistral 8x7B (Apache 2.0) ranks higher than some versions of GPT3.5-turbo. Claude and Gemini Pro also rank higher than some GPT3.5-turbo models, though they are proprietary.
