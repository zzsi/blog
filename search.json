    "text": "The Miracle and Pitfall of Demand-Driven Production\n\nThe miracle\nThe past two centuries have indeed been nothing short of a miracle in terms of economic growth, not just for the sheer scale of economic expansion but for its profound impact on human well-being.\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, global poverty was widespread, with the vast majority of the population living on subsistence agriculture, vulnerable to disease, famine, and political instability. But with the advent of mechanized production, steam power, and eventually electricity, societies began to shift from agrarian economies to industrial ones, spurring rapid urbanization and creating millions of new jobs.\n\n (source)\n\n (source)\nAs economies grew, so did living standards. In the 20th century, especially after World War II, growth accelerated dramatically. Advances in medicine, sanitation, and food production allowed populations to boom while simultaneously reducing mortality rates. Global poverty, which once seemed an inescapable fate for most, began to decline sharply. According to the World Bank, extreme poverty (defined as living on less than $1.90 a day) fell from about 80% of the world’s population in 1820 to less than 10% today. This reduction in poverty was most pronounced in Asia, where countries like China and India harnessed industrialization and global trade to lift hundreds of millions out of destitution.\nAs the engines of industry roared to life, they did more than just produce—they created a world where, for the first time, sufficient goods could be made to meet the needs of millions. Farms, once worked by hand, now harnessed the power of machines, yielding crops at unprecedented rates. Factories churned out textiles, tools, and eventually, the comforts of modern living that had once been unimaginable luxuries. This newfound capacity wasn’t just about survival; it was about abundance. Goods that had once been scarce or accessible only to the wealthy became attainable for the masses. Food production soared, homes were built, and technologies that improved everyday life spread across the globe. In this wave of growth, the world became a place where production was not only sufficient but could also fulfill the aspirations of those who sought more than just the bare necessities.\n\n\nThe pitfall\nWhile we feel grateful for the growth and abundance that this era of production has brought us, it’s important to recognize the shadows cast by this prosperity. For every product that meets a need, there are countless others that sit unused, discarded, or wasted. The very systems that allowed us to produce more than ever before also led to overproduction, filling landfills with excess and polluting our air and waters with the byproducts of unchecked growth.\n\n\n\nCar graveyard after Chinese company went bankrupt.

The so-called “clothing graveyard,” about 30,000 tons of discarded clothing piled in a landfill in the Atacama Desert, Chile, in 2021. Source: Antonio Cossio—picture alliance/Getty Images\n\n\nIs such a level of waste inevitable? I would argue that it is, given the nature of how our economies have evolved. The growth we’ve witnessed, particularly over the last century, has been driven largely by demand—an insatiable appetite for more. With the rise of consumerism, the focus shifted from simply meeting needs to creating new desires. As historian Frederick Allen observed, “Business had learned as never before the importance of the ultimate consumer. Unless he could be persuaded to buy and buy lavishly, the whole stream of six-cylinder cars, super heterodynes, cigarettes, rouge compacts, and electric ice boxes would be dammed up at its outlets.” (source)\nThis relentless push to fuel demand led companies to innovate not just in production but also in persuasion. Advertising, marketing, and product design all became tools to keep the consumer engaged and always wanting more. The result? A system where the pressure to buy, to replace, and to upgrade created a cycle of overproduction and, inevitably, waste."

    "text": "Is consumerism at fault?\nThe solution is not to stay away from consumerism and demand-driven market economy. Without demand, there would be no profit, and without profit, companies would have no reason to put products on the market. This, in turn, would halt productivity, leaving not enough food on families’ tables or goods in their homes.\nOver-production is also inevitable. The reality is that producing just enough to meet actual needs isn’t sufficient, because market systems and distribution networks are inherently imperfect. Food, clothes that are produced do not always reach who need them. True efficiency is hard to achieve, and inequality makes this even worse. If the distribution efficiency is only 10%, then we must produce ten times the necessary amount to meet the demand. This excess production, while ensuring availability, often leads to surplus and waste.\nSurplus eats into profits if it isn’t consumed. To keep factories running, corporations thriving, and jobs secure, our dear consumers must continually want more. This is the crux of the demand-driven economy: without constant consumption, the entire system risks stagnation. As a result, businesses invest heavily in marketing, innovation, and new product lines to stimulate desire, encouraging consumers to keep buying—whether or not their needs have truly changed.\n\n\n\nGrowth of supply and manufactured demand beyond need"

    "section": "A way out: targeted production with AI",
    "text": "A way out: targeted production with AI\nAmazon’s inventory planning system points to a promising direction. Algorithms can forecast what consumers are likely to purchase with remarkable accuracy, which allow buying and placing inventory accordingly to optimize order fulfillment. As a result, efficiency went up, and waste went down.\nAnd we can push this even further. If demand is way higher than actual need, why not shift production to better match what people really need? Imagine if we weren’t constantly hit with endless ads and social media bragging. Our homes would be less cluttered, people wouldn’t need to take on debt just to keep up with the luxury status game, and we could all spend more time with loved ones or out in nature. Life would feel simpler and more focused on what really matters, rather than being driven by overconsumption.\nThis can happen through targeted production, with AI helping in two ways: automation (boosting production efficiency) and forecasting (improving market efficiency).\nAutomation isn’t new—it’s been part of past tech revolutions—but AI is different because it’s more versatile. It can handle many things from language tasks to tool use, extending the ‘Crown Jewels’ of human intelligence. AI can streamline workflows across corporate functions like accounting, finance, engineering, sales, and marketing, making processes faster and more efficient. Forecasting will further increase market efficiency by accurately predicting demand, allowing businesses to align production more closely with real-time consumer needs. These two factors—automation and forecasting—make anticipatory production and just-in-time production possible. Instead of waiting for demand to fully materialize, we can anticipate and initiate production just ahead of time—producing what is likely needed, when it’s needed.\nIndirectly, AI can help curb the constant stimulation of consumer desires. The problem isn’t advertising itself but rather the excessive advertising that arises in overcrowded, saturated markets. When businesses struggle to meaningfully differentiate their products, they rely heavily on aggressive marketing to capture attention, contributing to the cycle of overconsumption. This reflects poor planning and a lack of clear insight into what consumers truly need—a symptom of incomplete information and insufficient foresight into future demands.\nWhen businesses begin to realize they can be profitable with automation and better planning instead of excessive advertising, they can step back from the exhausting zero-sum game of trying to out-market each other. Their shareholders and employees can finally find peace."

SORA would be a frontier model at the resource-intensive end of the spectrum. We want to move in the direction of the green arrow, striving for lower training cost while maintaining high quality.\nAccess to vast computational resources, such as 10,000 A100 GPUs, is limited to a handful of organizations. Even if such resources were widely available, focusing solely on resource-intensive methods would be an inefficient use of our capabilities. The design space for training recipes is vast, and a strategic approach involves exploring this space through low-cost experiments before scaling up when confidence is high.\nThis raises an intriguing question: With a modest budget, is it possible to train a general-purpose video generation model comparable to SORA?"

    "section": "The need for controlling the domain complexity",
    "text": "The need for controlling the domain complexity\n\nThe challenge of training general-purpose models with limited resources\nSORA’s training costs likely run into tens of millions of dollars, driven by both data and model size. Larger datasets necessitate longer training times, while bigger models require both extended training periods and more high-end GPUs.\nIs it feasible to train a high-quality model with a significantly smaller dataset? This seems impossible due to the inherent complexity of our world. Are one million video clips sufficient to capture our world’s complexity? 10 Million? 100 Million? Probably more than that. While sample-efficient algorithms can help reduce the required data size, the order of magnitude for necessary data likely remains substantial.\nSimilarly, training a high-quality model with a much smaller architecture presents its own challenges. Unless a dramatically more efficient architecture than Transformers emerges, a small model would struggle to capture the complexity present in such vast datasets.\nTherefore, to make progress with limited resources, we must find ways to reduce the data size.\n\n\nExploring niche domains: A path to low-budget training\nNiche domains can be significantly simpler than our physical world, potentially allowing a few tens of thousands of observations to sufficiently represent the domain. With a drastic reduction in data size, smaller models and lower training costs become feasible.\nWe can conceptualize a series of domains, progressing from simple to complex:\n\n2D Flying MNIST (a 2D world with colorful handwritten digits moving at constant speed, bouncing off boundaries)\n2D arcade games (Pong, Breakout, etc.)\nAnime and cartoons\nLimited locations: video walkthroughs of 3D house models, fly-through views of objects (e.g., NERF models)\nLimited objects: close-up videos of specific subjects (e.g., dogs, selfie videos)\nLimited scenery: footage of hiking trails, beaches, etc.\nPublic video datasets: UCF-101, Panda-70M, InterVid, etc.\nThe real world, and our collective video reservoir.\n\nA strategic approach involves starting from the simplest domain and gradually progressing towards more complex ones. Effective training recipes discovered in simpler domains are expected to scale to more complex scenarios with straightforward increases in data and model size.\nInterestingly, this mirrors how humans learn: start from simple lessons and gradually build up to more complex concepts.\n\n\nPre-train or fine-tune?\nFine-tuning is an effective strategy to reduce training costs, but it comes with certain limitations:\n\nFixed architecture: The model’s architecture is predetermined, which can be a significant constraint as we may still be far from an optimal design for video generation tasks.\nVAE dependency: Pre-trained weights often rely on a specific Variational Autoencoder (VAE), limiting the design space and opportunities to further reduce training costs.\n\nDespite these limitations, fine-tuning has shown promising results. For example, the team at Lambda Labs open-sourced an intriguing Text2Bricks experiment, fine-tuning OpenSora weights on Lego videos. This project required approximately 1000 A100 GPU hours and 10,000 videos. We can anticipate further reductions in cost as more advanced pre-trained models become available and more sample-efficient fine-tuning algorithms are developed.\nFor my experiments, I try to find the simplest domain that has non-trivial complexity: a toy 2D world with flying digits. The scale of this toy world is small enough that pre-training from scratch is not prohibitively expensive, allowing for more freedom in exploring different model architectures and training strategies.\nLet’s see some details."

    "text": "VAE: The Compressor\nThe first model to train is a compressor. Unlike language, images and videos have very high dimensionality: a tiny 2-second 256x256 video contains over 100 million numbers. Compression is necessary for the model to work.\nThe compressor of choice is a VAE (Variational Auto-Encoder) with an encoder and decoder. The encoder converts a video clip into a latent space, and the decoder converts the latent space back to a video clip. The latent space is a compact representation of the original data and is easier to model.\nOptionally, you can quantize the latent space using vector quantization, which gives you a VQ-VAE. Quantization gives rise to a vocabulary of visual words or tokens. This enables the use of language model training recipes on 1-dimensional (flattened) sequences of token IDs. While I was initially skeptical, the results were surprisingly good.\nTraining a small VAE is relatively quick. I trained a spatial-temporal VQ-VAE with 4x temporal compression and 4x4 spatial compression, using a vocabulary size of 5120. The training run documented in Weights & Biases achieved a good balance of reconstruction quality and compression rate. It took about 2 A10 GPU hours to converge.\nWith this VAE model, you can transform a 32-frame video clip (32 x 3 x 256 x 256) into latent “tokens”. Without quantization, the compressed representation of the video has a shape of 8 x 4 x 64 x 64 (each “token” is a 4-dimensional floating point vector, and there are 8 x 64 x 64 = 32,768 tokens). With quantization, the compressed representation is simply 8 x 64 x 64 = 32,768 integers (token IDs). The range of the token IDs is from 0 to 5,023.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this compact tokenized representation, we are ready to train a generator."

    "text": "Generator in the Latent Space\nThere are two approaches to generate video in the latent space: the autoregressive next-token predictor (language model) and the diffusion model.\n\nAutoregressive Next-Token Predictor\nEach 32-frame video clip is represented as a sequence of 32,768 tokens. The video clips are then concatenated to form a long sequence, separated by a special start-of-video token. This long sequence is fed into a language model training recipe.\nI used nanoGPT to train a 60MB model with the GPT-2 architecture. The model is trained to predict the next token ID in the latent space, instead of the next English token. It worked surprisingly well and began to learn the spatial-temporal patterns quickly.\nThe main ingredient for video quality is ensuring a sufficiently large context window. I used 6,000 tokens, which is much larger than the typical GPT-2 setting. However, this is still a small window size for video. Each video frame is 4,096 tokens, so this context window allows the model to look back only slightly more than one frame, making temporal consistency challenging to enforce.\nSecondly, the training sample size is crucial. Using 100k clips produces better results than 10k clips, and much better than 1k clips. The question remains whether we should use even more data. I hope not, as if such a simple 2D world requires much more than 100k training examples, it would be concerning for more complex domains.\nThis training run showcases one of the better results using nanoGPT.\nThe generated videos start out as random compositions of visual tokens:\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nAfter 6 hours of training, line strokes started to appear:\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n24 hours in, the digits began to emerge, but temporal consistency was poor:\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nAfter 10 days, consistency and physics were much improved:\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nFor comparison, here’s a training run using a 1,024 token context window.\nWith a smaller context window, the training time is much shorter (1 day to converge), but temporal consistency is poor, and digits would suddenly appear throughout the clip:\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\nDiffusion Model\nFor the diffusion model, I used ST-DIT from OpenSora and Stable Diffusion’s SD VAE.\nIn this approach, the context window encompasses the entire video clip, so I expected more temporal consistency than the autoregressive counterpart. Training sample size still plays a significant role. Using a 24GB A10 GPU, I needed to use a small version of the diffusion transformer model.\nA representative training run can be found here.\nThe generated videos also start out as random compositions of visual tokens (resembling crops of natural images this time):\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nAfter one day of training, localized dream-like flowing patterns emerged, though they didn’t yet resemble digits:\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nOn day 3, the moving patterns began to look like digits, but they were so fluid that they seemed to lack “bones”-like structure:\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nBy day 10, the digits were much more stable and distinct, and the moving patterns were steady and smooth:\n\n\nVideo"

There are numerous new techniques that are worth exploring to improve quality while reducing cost.

If you prefer to not use docker, you can install the dependencies manually by following the instructions in the Dockerfile in the same directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the code\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Run the code\nbash examples/sports/soccer_game_visual_tracking/predict.sh\nThis will use the docker image to run the code. If you prefer to run the code without docker, you can directly use the command in the predict.sh script in the same directory.\nIn this script, we are using a 30 second clip from a soccer game. The script will track the pitch and players, identify the team, goal keepers, referee, and ball, and generate a bird’s eye view video. Feel free to modify the script to use a different video or to change the tracking parameters.\nYou will find the output video in examples/sports/soccer_game_visual_tracking/0bfacc_0-radar.mp4. This is the video shown on the top of the page. On a machine with a GeForce RTX 3090, it takes about 20 minutes to run, with 3GB of GPU memory used."

The ball is very small in the image, so it is hard to detect.\nA multi-object tracking model to track the players and the ball (Bytetrack, implementation and python API).\nA vision embedding model and clustering algorithm for team identification. SigLIP is used to extract embedding vectors from cropped players. UMAP is used for dimensionality reduction. K-means is used for clustering. Also Resolve the team IDs for detected goalkeepers based on the proximity to team centroids (based on player locations).\nAn image registration/stitching algorithm to create the bird’s eye view. Homography is estimated between the pitch keypoints and the reference coornidates of the pitch, using OpenCV’s findHomography. The pitch in the footage is then warped to a top-down view using perspectiveTransform.\nPlayer re-identification models (e.g. MOTIP). When the footage is cut or camera is changed to a different angle, the player IDs are lost. We need to re-identify the players in order to connect the player tracks across different clips. I did not find the implemetation in this POC."

    "text": "Does it work on other soccer videos?\nI picked a random soccer game clip, and the result is not as good as the example video. The camera moved faster, zooming in to a partial view of the pitch near the goal post. This posed challenges to the keypoint detection model, and the player tracking model. Some players were not detected due to motion blur and occlusion. Key points of the pitch were not detected in some frames, and the algorithm was not able to create a bird’s eye view for those frames. The result is shown below:\nVideo\nRegardless, it is a great starting point to build a more reliable system for soccer game analytics. For fun, I also tried it on a very challenging video with a couple of professional players against 100 pupils. Interestingly, the algorithm was able to detect most the players, and create a bird’s eye view, as long as a large portion of the pitch is visible:"

It was trained on LVIS and COCO, capable of tracking 1000+ categories of objects. Below is the result for tracking persons and the ball. It also identified the billboards though they are not directly useful for our purpose here.

It can detect objects that are not in the training set, and can be used for zero-shot object detection. You can prompt it with a list of words, such as “player, ball, goal keeper”.\nCompared to Grounding DINO, YOLO World seems less accurate and misses some players when they overlap.\n\n\n\nYOLO-World-XL player detection result.\n\n\nThese are just two examples of recent models."

Commercial services promise instant, face‑matched albums, but I wanted full control, zero recurring fees, and the fun of hacking on state‑of‑the‑art vision models.\nOne rainy afternoon I realised the open‑source ecosystem had quietly delivered everything I needed: world‑class detectors, OCR, trackers, even highlight scorers—all installable with pip.

Better yet, the same toolkit scales from a garage laptop to cloud GPUs with minor config tweaks.\nIf you give this workflow a spin, drop your questions or tweaks on the starter repo—community pull requests have already added rugby‑specific digit datasets and support for hockey helmet numbers.\nUntil then, keep the shutters clicking and the memories flowing."

Smart machines now shoulder the algebraic slog, freeing humans to focus on conceptual synthesis, creative problem‑finding, and ethical foresight.

    "text": "Overview: Academic benchmarks like those from Epoch AI or BIG-Bench test “book smarts”—general knowledge, theoretical reasoning, and symbolic problem-solving. While these are important, organizations deploying AI systems in the real world care more about “street smarts”: practical problem-solving, workflow orchestration, business insight generation, and actionability. These skills are rarely captured in generic academic benchmarks. What’s needed are practical, vertically focused business benchmarks—evaluations that measure how well AI systems, agents, and toolchains perform in the messiness of real-world work. This document surveys such benchmarks, identifies where gaps remain, and outlines how AI consulting firms are uniquely positioned to create the next wave of impactful, street-smart evaluations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMgmtBench (ICLR 2024): Includes 610 short management “mini-cases” across strategy, operations, marketing, and finance. Each case presents a ~200-word scenario followed by either MCQs or open-ended prompts, with structured rubrics and automated grading via ROUGE/BLEURT.\nConsultBench (ACL 2024): Contains 150 full-length dialog-style consulting case interviews, scored on criteria like issue tree structure, quantitative reasoning, and recommendation quality.\nBizQA v1.0 (2024): Derived from MBA course exams and books like Case in Point, BizQA contains 12k short-answer Q&A pairs across domains like accounting, strategy, and economics.\n\nInsight: These benchmarks simulate traditional consulting knowledge tasks. Models fine-tuned on domain data and supported with tool-use (e.g. Pandas, calculators) outperform zero-shot LLMs by wide margins. Yet even top-tier models fall short of human consultants, especially in open-ended reasoning and strategic synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nB-Suite (NeurIPS 2025, under review): Introduces 45 interactive business simulations involving pricing, market entry, supply chain planning, and more. Each simulation requires the model to act as a decision agent, stepping through a task with reward feedback and programmatic scoring.\n\nInsight: Tool-augmented agents using planning + execution loops (e.g. Python calculators, scratchpads) consistently outperform pure generative baselines. But solving these simulations remains hard: most models complete fewer than 25% optimally. This underscores the challenge of multi-step, tool-intensive reasoning in complex domains.\n\n\n\n\n\nExecBench (ICML 2025): Provides ~220 CEO memos (some with tabular exhibits) that require summarization into a 3-slide board deck. Scoring focuses on clarity, insightfulness, and strategic actionability, as rated by expert MBAs and executives.\n\nInsight: Tasks mimic real business reporting workflows. RAG-enhanced LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o + LlamaIndex over investor letters) score near human average (~3.9/5 vs ~4.2). However, handling mixed media (text + charts) and inferring deeper strategic insights still present difficulties.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedQA and MedMCQA: Evaluate USMLE-style medical Q&A.\nBenchHealth (closed): Evaluates nuanced clinical reasoning under uncertainty.\n\nInsight: Medical benchmarks test high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. LLMs often need grounding via structured knowledge bases, and performance is brittle without prompt engineering or tool use. Hallucinations can be dangerous—highlighting the need for faithfulness checks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinQA and ConvFinQA: Test a model’s ability to compute values from financial reports and tables.\nFinanceBench (internal, 2025): Designed to test LLMs on compliance-sensitive KPI modeling, cashflow projections, and risk analysis tasks.\n\nInsight: Text-only models struggle with math-heavy finance tasks. Those integrated with spreadsheets or calculator tools perform better. Compliance reasoning (e.g. interpreting financial regulation) remains underdeveloped.\n\n\n\n\n\nLegalBench: Tests statute application, rule classification, and clause interpretation.\nCaseHOLD: A classification benchmark for matching facts to case law holdings.\n\nInsight: Legal LLMs must parse complex logic and jurisdictional nuance. Most current models can extract clauses but fail to reason across multiple statutes or case precedents.\n\n\n\n\n\nCLASSIC (ICLR 2025 Workshop): A benchmark built from 2,133 real enterprise chat logs in domains like IT, HR, banking, and healthcare. Tasks involve identifying the correct workflow, maintaining safety, and minimizing latency.\n\nInsight: Unlike static QA, CLASSIC tests real workflow reasoning and escalation. Top agents achieve ~76% accuracy, with large variance in safety behavior (some fail 20%+ of jailbreak tests).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical\nBenchmark Coverage\nGaps\n\n\n\n\nMarketing & Sales\nVery limited\nAd generation, audience targeting, CRM summarization\n\n\nRetail & E-commerce\nSparse\nProduct search, catalog curation, Q&A, inventory flow\n\n\nLogistics\nOnly simulations\nReal-world routing, demand prediction, ERP integration\n\n\nHR\nAbsent\nResume screening, policy QA, onboarding workflows\n\n\nManufacturing\nNone\nSensor log parsing, factory optimization, root-cause\n\n\n\nThese are pain point areas where no robust public benchmarks exist. They remain largely unmeasured and unexplored by the LLM community.\n\n\n\n\nMultimodal inputs: Few benchmarks evaluate AI agents working across documents, tables, and charts in a unified task.\nSpreadsheet + tool interop: Most benchmarks lack steps where an agent edits Excel, runs SQL, or invokes dashboards.\nMemory over time: Benchmarks test single turns or short episodes; few assess agents persisting knowledge over sessions.\nMessy real-world data: Academic benchmarks are too clean. Business data is noisy, outdated, or incomplete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI consulting firms interact with client pain points daily.

    "text": "From “solo data‑scientist lifestyle hacks” to fully‑autonomous, multi‑agent pipelines that quietly earn gold medals while you sleep.\n\nKaggle competitions remain the world’s favourite real‑world stress test for tabular, vision, NLP and time‑series modelling. The 2024‑2025 cycle delivered a step‑change in automation: large‑language‑model (LLM)–powered agents can now plan, code, tune and submit end‑to‑end solutions—often ranking above the median human competitor and sometimes reaching the gold range with &lt; $30 of GPU time.\n\nTL;DR — Multi‑agent frameworks such as AutoKaggle, DSMentor and Agent K stitch together planning, coding, hyper‑parameter tuning and error recovery. Benchmarks like MLE‑bench provide a public leaderboard to measure progress, and the open‑source repos below let you reproduce results in an afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstant, objective feedback → the public/private leaderboard pair forces generalisation.\nDiverse modalities → CSVs, JPEGs, long text, parquet time‑series all live under one roof.\nReproducible APIs → the kaggle CLI makes scripted downloads and submissions trivial.\nHard resource caps → competitions often restrict GPUs, RAM and runtime, nudging research toward efficient agents rather than compute‑hungry prototypes.\nRich community artefacts → human notebooks, discussion threads and forums become a free “knowledge base” that retrieval‑augmented agents can mine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave\nEra\nCore idea\nTooling examples\n\n\n\n\nAutoML 1.0\n2017‑2019\nBlack‑box model & feature search\nTPOT, Auto‑Sklearn, H2O AutoML\n\n\nAutoML 2.0\n2020‑2023\nTask‑specific ensembling, meta‑learning\nAutoGluon, GAMA, TabPFN\n\n\nLLM‑Agents 3.0\n2024‑2025\nLLM orchestrates planning → coding → tuning → submission loops\nAutoKaggle, DSMentor, Agent K\n\n\n\n\nKey leap (2024) — letting the LLM read eval logs and modify its own code closed the last mile between template notebooks and leaderboard‑ready submissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuite\nLaunch\nScope\nWhat it measures\n\n\n\n\nMLE‑bench (GitHub)\n2025‑02\n75 historic Kaggle comps (2014 → 2025)\nNormalised score vs bronze–gold range · wall‑time cap · artefact size\n\n\nMLAgentBench (paper / code)\n2024‑09\n13 ML experimentation tasks built from Kaggle datasets\nPass/fail on full download → train → infer → save loop\n\n\nMLE‑Live / CoMind (paper)\n2025‑06\n4 rotating ongoing Kaggle comps\nLive leaderboard delta vs baseline every 24 h\n\n\nDSEval (paper)\n2024‑12\n40 Kaggle‑style micro‑tasks\nRubric over planning, coding, testing, docstring quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModality\n#Tasks\nIconic datasets\nPublic metric\n\n\n\n\nTabular ‑ classification\n22\nTitanic, IEEE‑Fraud\nAccuracy, AUC\n\n\nTabular ‑ regression\n13\nHouse Prices, M5 Forecast\nRMSE, RMSLE\n\n\nComputer Vision\n18\nHappy‑Whale, RSNA Pneumonia\nmAP, macro‑F1\n\n\nNLP / text\n17\nJigsaw Toxic, Quora Insincere\nF1, ROC‑AUC\n\n\nTime‑series\n5\nVentilator Pressure, NFL Big Data Bowl\nMAE, WRMSSE\n\n\n\nEach comp is tagged starter, intermediate or grandmaster to mirror historic medal difficulty.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  S0([Start]) --&gt;

75 comps = 75 data layouts → template fatigue.\nCache everything – pre‑processing and feature matrices; MLE‑bench penalises wall‑time, not only compute.\nTreat CV/NLP separately – load pretrained checkpoints (Swin‑V2‑B, DeBERTa‑V3‑Large) and focus the agent on augmentations, not architecture search.\nMonitor artefact size – AutoKaggle auto‑prunes to top‑5 checkpoints to respect the 50 GB cap.\nLog everything – ship metrics to Weights & Biases or MLflow so the LLM can read past runs for critique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti‑modal contexts – unify image + tabular features in a single prompt cycle.\nRobustness to private splits – mitigate leaderboard overfitting via cross‑validation ensembles.\nInteractive error‑analysis UIs – let humans patch mis‑typed column names in one click.\nOn‑the‑fly model distillation – compress ensembles to meet runtime SLAs.\nCarbon‑aware scheduling – optimise agent search phases for green energy windows.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalised score — (agent − baseline) / (gold‑median − baseline), 1.0 ≈ typical gold medal.\nHP‑tune — Hyper‑parameter tuning.\nPBT — Population‑based training.\nScratch‑pad — JSON or vector memory the agent uses to store thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLi et al. 2024.

    "section": "",
    "text": "On a gray Tuesday morning, María Alvarez sat at her kitchen table, laptop open, eyes darting between half‑finished coffee and a health‑insurance marketplace she barely understood. She was forty‑nine, newly self‑employed, and one misclick away from locking herself into a plan that could swallow half her annual income—or leave her uncovered when she needed care most. The instructions were written in courteous but opaque prose, the deductible tables hid behind hyperlinks, and actuarial terms—coinsurance, out‑of‑pocket maximum, formulary tiers—bloomed like weeds everywhere she looked.\nSo María did what many of us do: she guessed. She chose the third cheapest plan, prayed she was healthy enough, and hoped she hadn’t made a catastrophic mistake.\nIf María had been facing a criminal charge instead of an insurance portal, she would have had the U.S. Constitution at her back. The Sixth Amendment guarantees her the right to competent legal counsel, paid for by the state if she cannot afford it. Society long ago recognized that ordinary citizens cannot possibly match the technical skill, specialized language, and professional resources of prosecutors. We insist on balance—not because every defendant is innocent, but because dignity demands everyone participate meaningfully in decisions that can upend a life.\nThe digital world has reached a similar tipping point. Algorithms weigh in on everything from credit limits to college admissions; bureaucracies publish ever‑expanding rulebooks; corporations negotiate contracts in font sizes small enough to dodge notice. The gap between expert knowledge and everyday understanding is now a canyon, and it is widening faster than traditional institutions can respond.\nThat is why I believe we should begin talking seriously about a new civic guarantee: a right to sufficient AI advisory.\n\n“If technology is a form of power, then access to the best advice it can synthesize is a form of freedom.”\n\n\n\nThe Counsel Analogy—And Where It Breaks\nWhen Clarence Earl Gideon stood before the Supreme Court in 1963, penniless and accused of burglary, he asked for a lawyer. The Court agreed he had a constitutional right to one, cementing the idea that some forms of expertise are so instrumental to justice that government must help supply them. Today, prosecutors still outnumber public defenders and funding remains tight, but the principle is uncontested: navigating criminal law without a guide is fundamentally unfair.\nNow replace the courtroom with a mortgage refinancing screen, or a disability‑benefit appeal, or a small‑business tax schedule. We are again asking citizens to decode labyrinthine systems written by specialists, enforced automatically, and outcome‑determinative for livelihoods. The difference is scale: millions more daily interactions, far less theatrical than a trial, but cumulatively just as consequential.\nAnd yet the modern state offers little beyond PDF instructions and understaffed call centers. Private‑sector tools exist—chatbots that suggest tax deductions, symptom‑checker apps, credit‑card comparison sites—but these come with advertising incentives, hidden data harvesting, or narrow purpose. They owe no fiduciary duty to the user. They are not counsel; they are sales reps wearing AI skins.\n\n\n\nWhat Does “Sufficient” Mean?\nLawyers are judged by a standard of competence that evolves as precedent and practice mature. A right to AI advisory would need its own evolving yardstick. Here is a starting sketch:\n\nCompetence: The advisor must meet a statistically validated accuracy threshold and surface the provenance of its suggestions. Explaining why Plan A is safer than Plan B cannot be optional.\nIndependence: It must be structurally insulated from the organizations whose products or rules it critiques—no undisclosed referral fees, no upsells embedded in advice.\nAccessibility: Free at the point of use, multilingual, and designed for people with limited digital literacy or disabilities. In effect, an ADA for algorithms.\nPrivacy: User data stays siloed, encrypted, and never sold. Recall how attorney‑client privilege undergirds trust; an AI counterpart needs similar guardrails.\n\nIf those criteria sound ambitious, remember that Gideon did not instantly materialize armies of public defenders; it set an aspiration, forcing institutions to build toward it.\n\n\n\nEarly Glimpses of the Future\nYou can already see prototypes flickering into existence. Estonia’s nationwide “Kratt” virtual assistant helps residents navigate government services in natural language. Spain’s Carta de Derechos Digitales enshrines a right to algorithmic transparency. The European Union’s AI Act, passed in 2024, classifies public‑service AI as “high‑risk,” demanding audits and human oversight. None of these, however, amount to a right to personal AI counsel. They regulate providers, not empower citizens.\nOn the commercial side, TurboTax’s AI coach and the NHS’s 111 triage chatbot inch closer, yet both remain company properties, not public assets. Their loyalties are negotiated by terms of service, not constitutional mandate.\n\n\n\nWhy Enshrine a Right?\nCognitive Equity The internet gave us universal publishing; AI promises universal analysis. Leaving that promise to market forces risks entrenching a new knowledge aristocracy—the well advised versus the algorithmically outmatched.\nProcedural Justice Whether you receive cancer treatment, student‑loan forgiveness, or child‑care subsidies increasingly hinges on opaque risk scores and rule checks. A right to AI advisory restores a measure of symmetry between citizen and system.\nEconomic Efficiency Mistakes are expensive. The 2019 Dutch child‑benefit scandal—where flawed fraud algorithms wrecked thousands of families—will cost billions in reparations and lost productivity. Preventive advice is cheaper than post‑hoc scandal management.\nDemocratic Feedback Aggregated, anonymized queries can reveal which statutes confuse citizens most, guiding legislators toward clearer drafting—an iterative loop of governance enhanced by data.\n\n\n\nCommon Pushback—and Rebuttals\n“Won’t people become dependent on AI?” Some will; many already rely on GPS. The goal is not to replace human judgment but to scaffold it. Just as a lawyer doesn’t rob you of agency, neither would an advisory model that explains choices, cites evidence, and invites override.\n“AI is biased; why codify its role?” Because bias thrives in darkness. A statutory right would come bundled with audit requirements, redress mechanisms, and a public‑interest mandate—the opposite of today’s unregulated chatbots.\n“This sounds expensive.” Training a domain‑specific language model is orders of magnitude cheaper than staffing equivalent human expertise for every citizen interaction. Moreover, cost‑sharing frameworks—open‑source models, public cloud credits, civic‑tech partnerships—can drive marginal costs toward zero.\n“Private companies already offer tools.” Public defenders coexist with private attorneys; both have roles. The right protects those who cannot afford premium services and compels baseline quality across the board.\n\n\n\nHow Might We Get There?\n\nStatutory Seeds Congress or parliaments could graft an advisory clause onto existing consumer‑protection or administrative‑procedure acts, starting with high‑impact domains like healthcare or housing.\nPilot Sandboxes Governments partner with universities and civic nonprofits to deploy open‑weight models, testing accuracy, bias, and user experience on opt‑in populations.\nCertification and Liability An oversight body—think Financial Ombudsman meets Public Defender—licenses advisory systems, rescinds certification for repeated harms, and adjudicates complaints.\nOpen Rulebooks Agencies publish regulations in machine‑readable formats, allowing continuous retraining and independent verification.\n\nHistory teaches that rights evolve from practice as much as proclamation. Small pilots snowball into expectations, expectations ossify into precedent, and precedent hardens into law.\n\n\n\nA Global View\nThe conversation won’t unfold only in Washington or Brussels. Kenya’s Huduma number, India’s Aadhaar‑linked welfare portals, and Brazil’s open‑government data initiatives all raise the same question: When digital systems mediate citizenship, what guarantees shield the individual? A right to AI advisory could become a lingua franca of digital rights, traveling across legal cultures the way freedom of expression did in the twentieth century.\n\n\n\nClosing Thoughts: Choosing the Future We Inhabit\nNear the end of Gideon’s Trumpet, Anthony Lewis writes that Gideon’s victory mattered not because it freed one man, but because it signaled America’s capacity for self‑correction. The machinery of law bent, however incrementally, toward fairness.\nWe stand at another inflection point. The machinery now is digital, the decisions diffuse, the stakes disguised under user‑agreement click‑boxes. Yet the principle endures: power without accessible counter‑power breeds injustice. Granting every citizen a right to sufficient AI advisory would not make bureaucracy disappear, but it would supply the flashlight, the map, and the translator that modern life increasingly demands.\nMaría Alvarez should not have to gamble her health on a hunch. Neither should you.\nIf technology is to remain a tool of emancipation rather than domination, counsel by code may be the right whose hour has come."

I want to emphasize the range of disciplines: physics, chemistry, biology, economics, sociology, computer science, data science, you name it. But in this post I would like to dedicate my attention to causal inference."

    "text": "Causal Inference and LLMs\n\n\n\n\n\nCausal inference is such an important decision making tool in life and in business. However, to be an expert in this field takes years of mathematical and statistical training. LLMs on the other hand are easy to use, but they lack rigor when reasoning about causality.\nIntegrating causality into LLM agents addresses limitations on both sides:\n\nPure causal methods demand strict assumptions and expert guidance.\nLLMs overflow with knowledge yet often mistake correlation for causation.\n\nBy wiring LLM‑based agents to specialized causal inference libraries, we can automate the causal workflow: discovery -&gt; identification -&gt; estimation -&gt; refutation. The result is a new class of general‑purpose causal AI systems that parse tabular, time-series, and even multimodal data with human-like intuition and mathematical rigor.\nPractically, that means the agent:\n\nThinks (via an LLM) about what causal graph should link your variables\nActs by writing Python: drawing DAGs, running ID algorithms, calling estimators, using libraries like dowhy, econml, causaltune, etc.\nReflects on the results, prompting itself with “Do my assumptions still hold?”\nIterates until a relevant answer surfaces, or it asks you for help.\n\nIf that sounds suspiciously like a data scientist teamate with infinite patience, you’ve got the gist.\n\n10 lines of code for your first causal inference agent\nTo illustrate the idea, here is a minimal snippet to estimate the effect of a new coupon on revenue. This may actually be sufficient to get you a quick answer, if (a big if) the data is ready.\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom dowhy import CausalModel\nfrom causaltune import AutoTune\n\ndef estimate_ate(df, treatment, outcome):\n    model = CausalModel(data=df, treatment=treatment, outcome=outcome)\n    ided = model.identify_effect()\n    best = AutoTune(model, df).best_estimator_\n    return model.estimate_effect(ided, method_name=best)\n\nagent = initialize_agent(\n    llm=OpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-4o-mini\"),\n    tools=[Tool.from_function(estimate_ate)],\n    agent_type=\"openai-tools\"\n)\n\nagent.run(\"Estimate the uplift of coupon_v2 on weekly revenue\")\nTime to look at some interesting papers and open source projects:\n\n\n\nSingle‑Agent Autonomous Pipelines\nCausal Agent framework (2024):\n\nAn LLM operates in a ReAct‑style loop with a suite of causal tools—e.g. CausalLearn for graph discovery and EconML for effect estimation.\nGiven a dataset and a query (e.g. “Effect of X on Y?”) the agent automatically:\n\nexplores variable correlations,\nhypothesizes causal links,\nproposes a causal graph,\ncomputes the quantitative effect of X on Y.\n\nEach step is backed by library outputs that the LLM interprets before deciding its next move.\n\nThe framework’s hierarchical breakdown (variable‑level, edge‑level, graph‑level, effect‑level) has produced expert‑level accuracy on a testing dataset with 1.3k questions, all while providing interpretable explanations.\n\nCausal-Copilot (2025)\n\nThe agent chains 20 + causal tools, from discovery to hyper-parameter tuning, inside a single LLM loop.\n\nWorks on both tabular and time-series data: prompts the user for a question, auto-selects the right discovery algorithm (e.g., NOTEARS, PC), tunes an estimator (DoubleML, CausalForest, IV), runs refuters, and returns an English report with effect size + CI.\nAchieves state-of-the-art graph accuracy and effect-estimation error across five public benchmarks, edging out both classic SCD baselines and earlier LLM agents.\n\n\n\n\nDebating Multi‑Agent Systems for Causal Discovery\nSingle agents sometimes hallucinate; multi‑agent approaches aim to reduce errors through debate and consensus.\n\nMulti‑Agent Causal Discovery Using LLMs (2024) assigns dedicated LLM roles:\n\nAffirmative Debaters proposes a DAG using temporal cues and domain priors.\nNegative Debaters attacks the proposal by surfacing hidden confounders, incorrect temporal orderings, or omitted variables.\nJudges evaluate arguments and pick the most plausible structure.\nCoders materializes the agreed-upon algorithm, reruns it on the entire dataset, and emits the refined graph.\n\n\nExperiments show these debating agents outperform both classical algorithms and single‑LLM prompts on datasets like Auto MPG, demonstrating that multiple specialized minds can yield more reliable causal graphs.\n\nChain-of-Collaboration Prompting (2025) shows that giving sub-agents explicit roles (planner, verifier, critic) and letting them share scratch pads improves causal reasoning accuracy on CLADDER and Causal-Copilot QA tasks, cutting hallucinated edges by 35 % vs. single-prompt ReAct.\n\n\n\nToolbox Layer (AutoML & No‑Code Platforms)\nParallel to LLM research, we also see AutoML‑style causal platforms that automate model selection, tuning, and robustness checks.\n\nAutoCausality: part of the PyWhy ecosystem, using hyper‑parameter search and ensembling to choose the best estimator for a dataset.\nOpportunityFinder (Amazon 2023) offers code‑less causal studies for panel data cleaning, cohorting, and computing effects (plus sensitivity) end‑to‑end.\nSalesforce CausalAI Library consolidates discovery and inference methods, synthetic data generators, and a no‑code GUI, scaling to larger problems via optimized multiprocessing.\n\nThese toolkits enrich agentic workflows: an LLM planner can mix‑and‑match discovery, estimation, and AutoML selection modules without human intervention."

    "text": "Evaluating Causal Inference Agents\nHow well do these causal inference agents perform? Here are some real or synthetic datasets and benchmarks.\nFor treatment‑effect estimation, the Lalonde job‑training study is a good place to start. It has real observational covariates paired with true RCT outcomes—to sanity‑check bias reduction. When larger, controlled replications are needed, you can use semi‑synthetic generators such as IHDP and the Twins dataset, whose perfect counterfactual comes from each twin’s paired outcome. The annual ACIC challenges extend this idea with dozens of high‑dimensional scenarios, while the 2025 RealCause generator allows people to create realistic Lalonde‑style benchmarks.\nFor longitudinal uplift studies, Amazon’s no‑code OpportunityFinder panels ship sample retail datasets ready for difference‑in‑differences.\nWhen it comes to graph discovery methods, people tend to use classic datasets such as the 11‑node Sachs protein‑signaling map, a real wet‑lab interventions dataset. Bayesian‑network classics like Asia and ALARM remain quick smoke tests. Pairwise direction algorithms rely on the Tübingen cause–effect pairs, and larger time‑series graphs come from gene‑regulation contests such as DREAM4.\nMore recently we see language‑centric causal benchmarks. CLADDER has 10k natural language questions across Pearl’s ladder, while ACCESS asks agents to build abstract causal graphs over multimodal vignettes before answering why queries.\nAs to multimodal causal inference, CausalVQA is a benchmark for video question answering (VQA) that test models’ understanding of causality in the physical world."

    "section": "Challenges and Mitigations",
    "text": "Challenges and Mitigations\nGoing beyond the happy path to production is often not a smooth ride. Here are some of common challenges in my experience:\n\nData Quality and the Missing Confounders\nObservational datasets rarely contain every variable that shapes a treatment–outcome relationship, so even a state‑of‑the‑art estimator can inherit hidden bias.\nTo mitigate, insert a human‑review checkpoint right after the agent proposes its first causal graph: domain experts eyeball edges and nominate missing covariates. The software then launches automatic robustness probes such as placebo tests, synthetic confounder injections, and other refutation modules shipped with DoWhy, to quantify how fragile the estimate is. Crucially, if any refutation fails, the planner LLM must stop, annotate the failure, and either revise the graph or escalate to a human reviewer; surfacing a shaky result as “tentative” is better than silently proceeding. Some teams also run a “data‑profiling agent” that scans fresh tables for covariate drift or sparsity and warns the planner before analysis starts.\n\n\nHallucinations and Over‑Confidence in Planner LLMs\nLLM planners are persuasive storytellers; a well phrased chain‑of‑thought can make a shaky causal graph feel ironclad.\nMulti‑agent debate is a good recipe to reduce hallucination: a second LLM plays devil’s advocate, and challenges the assumptions that make an estimate causal:\n\nPlacebo‑treatment test: replace the real treatment with a fake; any non‑zero effect flags hidden bias.\nSynthetic‑confounder injection: add a random common cause and observe the ATE shift; big swings imply unmeasured confounding.\nOverlap / positivity audit: verify that propensity scores span both arms; poor overlap triggers trimming or doubly robust methods.\nCross‑estimator consensus: pit a back‑door learner against an IV or front‑door estimator; disagreement above a threshold routes to human review.\nMulti‑agent debate: affirmative and negative debaters contest every edge, a judge scores coherence.\n\nIf any probe fails, the planner either tightens assumptions and reruns discovery or clearly labels the conclusion “inconclusive, additional data needed.” Final reports must surface the point estimate plus confidence intervals, sensitivity ranges, and a pass/fail tally for each refuter, so stakeholders see magnitude and robustness.\n\n\nModel‑Selection Over‑Fit and Cross‑Estimator Disagreement\nAuto‑tuning libraries can explore dozens of learners and hyper‑parameters, sometimes over‑fitting small causal datasets, especially with flexible models like causal forests. In this case, AutoML learns noise instead of real signal.\nMitigations include nested cross‑validation inside AutoCausality or causaltune, and parsimony priors that penalize needless complexity. If resource allows, the agent should run at least two conceptually different estimators, e.g., a back‑door regression and an instrumental‑variable model, and flag any large divergence in effect size as a red‑flag for human review.\n\n\nComputation Cost vs. Real‑Time Ambitions\nA planner–solver split can still burn thousands of tokens and heavy compute if the planner explores many what‑if branches.\nProduction dashboards cache discovery and refutation outputs keyed by a DAG hash; if the graph hasn’t changed, the agent re‑uses prior results. Another recipe is distilling a heavy LLM planner into a small fine‑tuned local model covers day‑to‑day traffic, while the costly cloud model handles weekly deep dives.\n\n\nPrivacy and Governance\nSensitive data such as medical records, customer logs usually cannot leave a private cluster.\nHybrid deployments solve this: an on‑prem LLM handles data‑aware steps, while a redacted summary (no PII) is sent to a cloud model for high‑level planning. All explanations pass through a redaction layer before logging, and every causal report carries an audit trail plus role‑based access controls."
